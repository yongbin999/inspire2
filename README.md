#Project Overview
Our main product is a class timeline application, where student can select and display the classes they would need to complete their degree. The idea is that this will ease the process of degree planning and course enrollment, so that there is no difficulty determining what classes to take and when. Students can have a better outlook when deciding on a major of what the course path will look like. Our focus will be to achieve seamless, undaunting usability so that students have no problem being informed of their degree paths. We will focus on the Umass computer science major to begin with, and branch out to other majors or other schools as time and resources permit us to. We also hope to provide functionality for administrators and counselors, and integration with third-party services. 

As described in detail in our proposal, our team consists of Yong Liang, Sam Fox, Josh Bearor, Andrew Marchetti, Khanh Nguyen, and Alex Revello. Although we will all be contributing to all of the segments of bringing this product to life, we have tentatively assigned roles that determine who will have the vision for certain parts of our implementation. Yong's role in the team will be to facilitate the progress of the releases cycles. He also will be looking into the database design and intergration with the server host. Sam will be in charge of design research, prototyping, and server implementation. Alex will also focus on server implementation but from the perspective of efficiency and debugging. Drew will be in charge of frontend UI design on the client side. Khanh will devise the database structure and query format. Josh will also format the database and general back-end design. His focus will be server/client communication.

In our docs/proposal directory, there is our written proposal both in the form of a markdown file and a PDF presentation. Our proposal includes detailed bios and role descriptions of each member of our team as well as our problem statement, product description, project timeline, and estimated costs.

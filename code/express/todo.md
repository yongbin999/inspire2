ProcessingJS. It's a javascript implementation of the the Processing language. If ProcessingJS doesn't work out, i'd recommend checking out D3js. It's more for visualizing data, but it might be useful for you. Lastly, i'd recommend checking out SVG. You can use it to draw images as well, and they're drawn using vectors.

For front-end stuff, you might find the tutorials on these websites cool / useful:

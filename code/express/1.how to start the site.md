notes to how to modify the files
if you need to add a page, you have to make sure go through these steps
routes/user   add get("/xxxx",
                      then render("student/abcde"

in the views you add your table/data  that is being rendered.
views/student/abcde.ejs

then use div and class to map out the block, then design and
update the views in
public/stylesheets/xxxx

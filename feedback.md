**Project 4**
--
This was a good submission. It was fairly detailed and gave enough of a sense you all have an idea of how your going to implement the features you want.

I noticed you have your UI as a challenge. If you really want the website to look nice, but don't want to take a huge amount of time away from implementing your features--esepcially getting the core features to work--I recommend checking out either Bootstrap or Foundation. Both are CSS frameworks that can be leveraged to build a nice looking website quickly. Just be aware of using too many divs; it might convolute the HTML a little bit.

After looking at the your slides, it seems like there's still a lot that needs to be done. So because of that, I would definitely recommend checking out either of those CSS frameworks and focus on getting all the core functionality working by the time the project is due.

**Trello:** The activity on here has been decent; it's nice to see you all are using it for the most part, and using it often enough.

**Meeting Notes:** Your meeting notes are good for the most part. Only problem I had with them is that 4 people had the same task "added component to the dspec." While this is fine for multiple people to have, it'd be nice if it included which components were added.

**Side Note:** I know I haven't mentioned anything about the logo in the past, but now that we're this far in, I definitely think you can do a better job on it. There are plenty of Photoshop tutorials on how to add some nice effects to text. Might be a good job for the person doing graphics.

This was a great submission. You were very detailed in each section. I liked the extra explanation in your screen-by-screens. It seems you know what you want you do, so keep up the good work.

I have noticed that Khanh, you have missed all group meetings; I recommend that you start going to them so I can better see your contributions to the group when it comes to developing the idea. So far it looks like you haven’t been apart of the development of the specifications and other documents. It is good to see you’ve contributed something to github though.

Your team notes were detailed as well and everyones roles were clearly outlined. Overall, great submission.

I actually really like this idea. It's really useful. If you can get the design looking great and have your core features working properly, this could gain some traction with the students here.

For things like the class timeline, I imagine you're going to want to disply them. For having interactive visuals, there are a few things I would recommend checking out. The first one is ProcessingJS. It's a javascript implementation of the the Processing language. If ProcessingJS doesn't work out, i'd recommend checking out D3js. It's more for visualizing data, but it might be useful for you. Lastly, i'd recommend checking out SVG. You can use it to draw images as well, and they're drawn using vectors.

WHAT YOU WERE MISSING: Research into other applications that are similar, or at least shown that you've tried to search for already existing versions of your idea. Additionally, you guys also missed where you have to add who on the team wrote the sections.


Great Job on the proposal and great job on the slides. Looking forward to seeing the finished produect. You've been fully funded; thumbs up!

Thumbs up! You guys did a great job on this assignment. Everything was nicely detailed. I'm enjoying this idea and looking forward to see how it develops over the semester. It'd be great to have something with a better UX than Spire.

It's good too see you using Trello as well. Make sure to keep using it, and good job on this submission.

Also, if you're interested in doing visualizations for the degree tracks, d3js might be good to check out.

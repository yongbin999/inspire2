**Project 3**
This was a great submission. You were very detailed in each section. I liked the extra explanation in your screen-by-screens. It seems you know what you want you do, so keep up the good work.

I have noticed that Khanh, you have missed all group meetings; I recommend that you start going to them so I can better see your contributions to the group when it comes to developing the idea. So far it looks like you haven’t been apart of the development of the specifications and other documents. It is good to see you’ve contributed something to github though.

Your team notes were detailed as well and everyones roles were clearly outlined. Overall, great submission.

I actually really like this idea. It's really useful. If you can get the design looking great and have your core features working properly, this could gain some traction with the students here.

For things like the class timeline, I imagine you're going to want to disply them. For having interactive visuals, there are a few things I would recommend checking out. The first one is ProcessingJS. It's a javascript implementation of the the Processing language. If ProcessingJS doesn't work out, i'd recommend checking out D3js. It's more for visualizing data, but it might be useful for you. Lastly, i'd recommend checking out SVG. You can use it to draw images as well, and they're drawn using vectors.

WHAT YOU WERE MISSING: Research into other applications that are similar, or at least shown that you've tried to search for already existing versions of your idea. Additionally, you guys also missed where you have to add who on the team wrote the sections.


Great Job on the proposal and great job on the slides. Looking forward to seeing the finished produect. You've been fully funded; thumbs up!

Thumbs up! You guys did a great job on this assignment. Everything was nicely detailed. I'm enjoying this idea and looking forward to see how it develops over the semester. It'd be great to have something with a better UX than Spire.

It's good too see you using Trello as well. Make sure to keep using it, and good job on this submission.

Also, if you're interested in doing visualizations for the degree tracks, d3js might be good to check out.

**Project 1:** Thumbs up! You guys did a great job on this assignment. Everything was nicely detailed. I'm enjoying this idea and looking forward to see how it develops over the semester. It'd be great to have something with a better UX than Spire.

It's good too see you using Trello as well. Make sure to keep using it, and good job on this submission.

Also, if you're interested in doing visualizations for the degree tracks, d3js might be good to check out.

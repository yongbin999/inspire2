<br><i>“inSPIRE A trail for success” </i>
Company Bio
===========
inSPIRE was founded by six recently discovered CS geniuses. Each individual has unique talents that contribute to the enormous success of the company. The company focuses on simple platform solutions that visually guide students on their course planning and enrollment. Students can advertise their profile to employers or post on career websites. At the end of their school journey, students will be able to share their experience on the series of classes they took. Upcoming new students inspired by the author can bump and follow their path to success. Administrators on the other hand, would be able to leverage this platform to create the relational class map, and anticipate the number of students interested in certain classes based on the sum of student profiles. 

+    **Goal:** We want to help students understand what courses and timeline they need to complete their CS degree. To ease their course planning process, we will be creating an interactive "Critical Path Analysis” web platform tool.

+    **Vision:** A new student portal for course planning with social media-like functionalities. This will be an upgrade to the SPIRE site, containing a visualization of CS tracks and interactive ARR by semesters. Potentially scale expansion into other majors, school, colleges.

+    **Target Audience:** 
     +    *Initial Target:* UMass Computer Science undergraduates
     +    *Near Future:* UMass Students in all majors, and department administrators
     +    *Long-term:* All students and administrators

+    **The Problems We Solve:** 
    +    No standard way of viewing course graduation paths (all schools, not just Umass CS)
    +    Hierarchy of prerequisite classes is confusing on paper, and unavailable in other forms
    +    SPIRE does not present the classes relevant to your path during enrollment. The burden is on the user to tailor class searches to themselves, which is an irritating process of navigating back and forth in the portal. 
    +    No simple way to account for courses only being offered in Fall/Spring in SPIRE portal, students sometimes do not graduate on time due to poor planning capabilities for required classes.
    +    Difficult to compare different paths and majors side-by-side, similarities and differences are not obvious
    +    Currently in career profiles, users are just listing their relevant classes. It’s hard to tell what those classes really mean, without seeing the trail of pre-req leading to that class.
    +    New incoming students are clueless about pre-reqs and classpaths, and seek guidance from the advisors who might not be the best resource. It’s difficult find and talk to juniors and seniors for the review for their class paths.
    +    SPIRE provides no compatibility with career resources like Career Connect of LinkedIn

----------------
Prior to studying CS, I was a Financial Analyst at EMC headquarter. During my time there, I worked closely with project managers and developers in our financial reporting tools. To my interest, I wrote several excel VBs to automate the monthly manual setups of our management reports package for the CEO. Being at the core of budget planning and street guidance, it’s astonishing to see where the investments are heading in the SaaS industry. The reason I joined the inSPIRE is because this will be a potential for real investments!

CS class taken: 121,187
Non-CS classes: 
Capstone Business Strategies - This class taught me the sphere of opportunity and risks that surrounds companies every day. For capstone project, I led my team in applying plan analysis for a simulation company by allocating resources for product development, marketing, finance, and HR to compete with other teams for market cap.
Game Theory Economics - This is one of the most interesting class that studies group behavior when face with cost/benefit decision. It quite useful to learn to plan accordingly since Nash equilibrium over the long term will almost always arrive at the predicted outcome.

I am from San Francisco, and prior to coming to UMass I was a professional sound engineer for a couple years. I am enrolled as a post-grad bachelors student and I have a BA in Philosophy (music minor) from University of California, Santa Cruz. Web Development is actually what made me serious about programming in the first place, when my friend and I made an app/service called “buried” (itsburied.com). That said, my friend was the master and I was the apprentice, so I’m hoping that this class will help me connect the dots. I also worked at IBM in UX Design. 

CS Courses Taken: (at previous college): C Programming, Intro to Networking, Object-Oriented Design, C++ Methodology, Data Structures, (at UMass): 220, 250, and currently taking 230, 240, 311, 326

Non-CS courses: *19th-Century Philosophy* (a class involving Hegel, Nietzsche, and Schopenhauer that presented really cool grand ideas and existentialism and the general direction of the human race), and *Jazz Improvisation Theory* (this class really had an impact on my skill as a musician).

Found wandering the laptop aisle of best buy in a trench coat and sunglasses, little is known about this man besides his fear of red jelly beans. He is wanted by every major law enforcement group for constantly hacking the mainframe, but he can never be caught because he is in private browsing mode. He has decided to lay low for a little while and work for inSPIRE while the feds lose his scent.

CS courses taken: 121, 187, 220, 230, 240, 250, 197C, 197U

Non-CS courses: Abstract algebra ( I really enjoyed the challenge and I find the subject very interesting since I want to study more about encryption) Comic Art in North America ( I love comics and learning about the history of them and being forced to read them for grades was pretty awesome)



Andrew Marchetti

As a tennis prodigy, life seemed easy. By age 17 I was already on the professional tour. 2004 was the best year of my life. Winning Wimbledon and the US Open in the same year was a dream come true. Then came my accident. On a rainy day, when the match should have been delayed, I tried to return a serve from my opponent, and good friend, Andre Agassi. I lost my footing and fell to the floor. Torn ACL. I spent the next year rehabbing, but my knee wasn’t the same. There was no way I could compete on the tour, my career was over. Then came programming. I was introduced to it in 2007 and I fell in love with application development. I’ve been searching for a team I believe in for quite some time now. I’m glad I finally found the inSPIRE team. I believe these people are motivated and talented enough to create a real world application that will help hundreds of hard-working and deserving students.


CS courses taken: 121, 187, 220, 250

Non-CS courses: I took introduction to Media Programming and Institutions as an elective my freshman year. This class gave me a great understanding of the culture, business, legal and political aspects of everyday media. I learned a lot more about the television, music and internet industries. Another class I enjoyed was Biology of Cancer and AIDS, which taught me to use my head and really changed my outlook on the two diseases.



Khanh Nguyen
--------------------
I am a senior CS student at UMASS, who has a lot of experiences with competitive programming. Recently, I have decided to shift my career from studying theoretical algorithms to building real-world applications. I am highly motivated by the idea of using redundantly available data in the Internet to build models that are capable of discovering hidden social phenomenon and predicting their future behaviors. Joining inSPIRE team, I wish to apply this idea to tackle numerous problems in academic environment. 

Fun fact: I love to sing but am too shy to sing aloud in public. 

CS courses taken: 121, 187, 197u, 220, 230, 240, 250, 383, 670, 688, 689

Non-CS courses: One of the courses that had most impact on me was WRITING 121, which taught me to write more effectively in English. Another course was MATH 455 (abstract algebra), in which I enjoyed learning the concepts that explained and linked together the different areas of math such as geometry, number theory and combinatorics.

I am currently a Junior CS major with an interest in both mobile app and web design.  I am interested in applications that have complete interaction with the people who use them.  I want to help develop services created specifically for the purpose of helping people grow and learn.  I joined the inSPIRE team to help students, both incoming Freshman, and rising Seniors, take the right path in their college career to get the most out of their education without having to worry if they can take a specific course or not.  I want inSPIRE to have a positive impact on every student that uses the service.

Currently at UMass I have taken Introduction to Programming in Java, Data Structures, Intro to C programming, Reasoning Under Uncertainty, Programming Methodology, and Intro to Computation.

Two non-CS courses that have impacted not only my education, but my life are Linguistic Anthropology and Western Thought to 1600.  These two classes taught me how to actually listen to spoken and written word to get a deeper understanding of the speaker and the world around me.

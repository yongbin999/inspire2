###### 'A Trail For Success'


## Meet the Team

#####Yong Liang
######Bio
Prior to studying CS, I was a Financial Analyst at tech company. Being at the core of budget planning and street guidance, it’s astonishing to see where the investments are heading in the IT SaaS industry. The reason I joined the inSPIRE is because this is a potential for real investments!

CS class taken: 121,187
Non-CS classes: 
Capstone Business Strategies - This class taught me the sphere of opportunity and risks that surrounds companies every day. For capstone project, I led my team in applying plan analysis for a simulation company by allocating resources for product development, marketing, finance, and HR to compete with other teams for market cap.
Game Theory Economics - This is one of the most interesting class that studies group behavior when face with cost/benefit decision. It quite useful to learn to plan accordingly since Nash equilibrium over the long term will almost always arrive at the predicted outcome.

######Role
Yong's role in the team will be to facilitate the progress of the releases cycles. He also will be looking into the database design and intergration with the server host.


#####Sam Fox
######Bio
I am from San Francisco, and prior to coming to UMass I was a professional sound engineer for a couple years. I am enrolled as a post-grad bachelors student and I have a BA in Philosophy (music minor) from University of California, Santa Cruz. Web Development is actually what made me serious about programming in the first place, when my friend and I made an app/service called “buried” (itsburied.com). That said, my friend was the master and I was the apprentice, so I’m hoping that this class will help me connect the dots. I also worked at IBM in UX Design. 

CS Courses Taken: (at previous college): C Programming, Intro to Networking, Object-Oriented Design, C++ Methodology, Data Structures, (at UMass): 220, 250, and currently taking 230, 240, 311, 326

Non-CS courses: *19th-Century Philosophy* (a class involving Hegel, Nietzsche, and Schopenhauer that presented really cool grand ideas and existentialism and the general direction of the human race), and *Jazz Improvisation Theory* (this class really had an impact on my skill as a musician). 

######Role- Design Research and Server Implementation
Sam will be conducting the user research from both the student perspective and the administrator perspective. This process involves iterations of UX Design, prototyping, and user testing. The goal here is to solidify our idea and make sure our features are validated. In addition to that he will be part of the team that designs and implements the cloud code in the way it processes and transfers data from the server to the client. 


#####Alex Revello 
######Bio
Found wandering the laptop aisle of best buy in a trench coat and sunglasses, little is known about this man besides his fear of red jelly beans. He is wanted by every major law enforcement group for constantly hacking the mainframe, but he can never be caught because he is in private browsing mode. He has decided to lay low for a little while and work for inSPIRE while the feds lose his scent.

CS courses taken: 121, 187, 220, 230, 240, 250, 197C, 197U

Non-CS courses: Abstract algebra ( I really enjoyed the challenge and I find the subject very interesting since I want to study more about encryption) Comic Art in North America ( I love comics and learning about the history of them and being forced to read them for grades was pretty awesome)

######Role
Alex is going to be doing the server side programming. He will optimize the server such that it runs quickly and efficiently. There will be no bugs and no way to hack in once he is finished.


#####Andrew Marchetti
######Bio
After starting off at UMASS as an undeclared student, I finally found programming. In my third semester as a CS major, I'm hoping to find if my passion is front end or back end. I’m glad I finally found the inSPIRE team. I believe these people are motivated and talented enough to create a real world application that will help hundreds of hard-working and deserving students. I feel this project will also give me a better feel for my interest in either back or front end development, as we will be doing a whole lot of each. 

CS courses taken: 121, 187, 220, 250

Non-CS courses: I took introduction to Media Programming and Institutions as an elective my freshman year. This class gave me a great understanding of the culture, business, legal and political aspects of everyday media. I learned a lot more about the television, music and internet industries. Another class I enjoyed was Biology of Cancer and AIDS, which taught me to use my head and really changed my outlook on the two diseases.

######Role
Andrew will be most concerned with front-end work and the interface. The goal is to have a very easy to use and visually satisfying program that cooperates well with the back-end and database. 


#####Khanh Nguyen
######Bio
I am a senior CS student at UMASS, who has a lot of experiences with competitive programming. Recently, I have decided to shift my career from studying theoretical algorithms to building real-world applications. I am highly motivated by the idea of using redundantly available data in the Internet to build models that are capable of discovering hidden social phenomenon and predicting their future behaviors. Joining inSPIRE team, I wish to apply this idea to tackle numerous problems in academic environment. 

Fun fact: I love to sing but am too shy to sing aloud in public. 

CS courses taken: 121, 187, 197u, 220, 230, 240, 250, 383, 670, 688, 689

Non-CS courses: One of the courses that had most impact on me was WRITING 121, which taught me to write more effectively in English. Another course was MATH 455 (abstract algebra), in which I enjoyed learning the concepts that explained and linked together the different areas of math such as geometry, number theory and combinatorics.  

######Role
Khanh's role will be to come up with our data modelling algorithm and database structure. He will be in charge of the way our data looks when being queried.
I will help with designing programs, factoring and testing code. I will also help with debugging errors. My main focus is to make the app run more efficiently in term of both memory and time. Another goal is to revise code style to strengthen the maintainability aspect of the app.   

#####Josh Bearor
######Bio
I am currently a Junior CS major with an interest in both mobile app and web design.  I am interested in applications that have complete interaction with the people who use them.  I want to help develop services created specifically for the purpose of helping people grow and learn.  I joined the inSPIRE team to help students, both incoming Freshman, and rising Seniors, take the right path in their college career to get the most out of their education without having to worry if they can take 
a specific course or not.  I want inSPIRE to have a positive impact on every student that uses the service.

Currently at UMass I have taken Introduction to Programming in Java, Data Structures, Intro to C programming, Reasoning Under Uncertainty, Programming Methodology, and Intro to Computation.

Two non-CS courses that have impacted me are Linguistic Anthropology and Western Thought to 1600.  These two classes taught me how to actually listen to spoken and written word to get a deeper understanding of the speaker and the world around me.

######Role
Josh's role will be maintaining the back-end designs, intergrration of the server/client, and database setup.



## Problem Statement
If you ask 100 UMass students what they think of the SPIRE portal for course enrollment, you’re likely to get less than a handful of positive reviews. The system is very difficult to navigate, and a student enrolling in classes has to refer elsewhere to make sure that selected courses are true to his or her degree path. Information about courses such as prerequisites, major relevancy, and semester offerings is all scattered in different places and hard to find (not to mention the fact that you have to navigate away from the page you are looking at to find a page with a different piece of information). An example of an unfortunate outcome of this is when a student has to take an extra semester just because that last class he needed for graduation was only offered in the fall. Or perhaps that student was unaware of a GE course that was missing. The way SPIRE is currently, it is very difficult to enroll in classes with the necessary foresight to avoid this kind of thing. The burden is on the student to manage his or her path, but SPIRE tries to organize classes by non-intuitive course numbers. And there are no means for viewing available courses in the context of degree requirements. 

In fact, there is no standard way of viewing your own graduation path other than on a piece of paper with something scribbled on it by your counselor, whom you only see once per semester. The hierarchy of prerequisite classes is sometimes confusing on paper, and in a lot of cases it changes frequently. And good luck trying to switch majors when there is no way to compare majors side-by-side in SPIRE either. SPIRE is not compatible with career services like CareerConnect or LinkedIn, which is functionality that would be very useful for employers trying to find people with the right skills. The problem staring us all in the face a lack of clarity, seamlessness, and consolidation of necessary information. Time spent dealing with these difficulties is time wasted. The process should be as painless as possible for students so that they can focus on what is actually important- their schoolwork. 



## Our Products

###### Core product
+	Our main product is a class timeline application, where student can select and display the classes they would need to complete their degree.
+	With this front end production, we can also introduce a product for the school/department admins to modify the class pre-reqs relationships.The admins would easily get an estimate summary of total student plans, which can help them plan ahead in assigning professors and classrooms. 

###### Social media 
+	To build on the student timeline application, we like to add in the social media aspect, where students can publish their class histories and plans on other websites, or as a link on their resume.
+	Another aspect of social media we like to implement is student experiences, comments on the path of classes they took. This will be available to other and be rated/ranked. This will be useful for new students to read, it will be like getting advising from a former student's perspective, which is difficult to do for most new students. 

###### Services
+	3rd party companies and employeer can submit request(fee) for student verification to the school admins on our site. This will be noted in the terms of service, that anyone will have the option to verify accuracy of the student profile.
+	Alternatively, students can choose self-verify(fee). This will archive their profile on our website like a "transcript". It will be useful for any type of job, internship, research, even college applications.

###### Related Courses
<u>Computer Science:</u>
CMPSCI187- This project will invole knowledge of data structures when it comes to the modeling of the entries in our database. We will likely have to use dynamic structures like the ones that we all learned about in this class. Linked lists, binary trees, and hash functions are all things that are very likely going to come into play. 

CMPSCI220- We will also have to think about design patterns. There is always more than one way to implement anything, and we have to make sure to implement our product with flexibility and extendability in mind. CMPSCI220 provided us with exactly this knowledge.

<u>Other Subjects:</u> 
Electronic Music- The primary difference between SPIRE and inSPIRE is that inSPIRE will feature seamless usability. A direct metaphor is to think about inSPIRE like music editing software, which provides things like cursor tools, keyboard shortcuts, and the ability to split workspaces into multiple windows. If we can make degree planning more like an art project and less like sticking needles in your eyes, we can make a substantial difference in degree planning. 

19th Century Philosophy- In this class Sam studied a book by Marshall McLuhan called "The Medium is the Message". This book talked about the importance of good design as it is what encapsulates the tools we use as extensions of our being. Our opinion is that SPIRE offers bad design and does not work in ways that are intuitive to our being. It is time to improve on this technology. Just as shoes are only effective if they mold to the shape of our feet, a student portal can only be effective if it properly molds to our mental models.

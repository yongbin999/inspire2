#Issues
  - We have little experience with UI's and making it all look good could prove difficult
- AJAX requests to populate shopping cart might be a pain to figure out
- Avoiding procrastination
- Making everything extendable and dynamically updateable
- Getting data for all the courses and tracks
- How to make students and their data easy to keep track of and store
- Dividing up work evenly and making it all work together on time
